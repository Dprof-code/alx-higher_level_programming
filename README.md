This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems related to high level programming and algorithms in the ALX Software Engineering program. As I progress in my learnings, I would be implementing solutions in the the Python programming language focus on understanding the fundamentals of programming and computer architecture.

Each subdirectory in the repository corresponds to a different topic, with detailed explanations of the problems and the approaches I took to solve them. Some of the topics covered in this repository include data structures, memory management, sorting algorithms, and much more.
